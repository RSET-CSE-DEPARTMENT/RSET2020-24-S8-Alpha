# Abstract
Our study introduces a novel framework that merges machine learning techniques
with electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis to effectively classify mental states of
stress and relaxation. We meticulously preprocess EEG signals to eliminate artifacts and
noise, followed by window segmentation. To achieve robust classification performance,
we devise a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored specifically for
learning discriminative features from EEG data, which is then rigorously trained and
evaluated. Additionally, we employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) to interpret the decisions made by the CNN model, offering valuable insights
into the neural mechanisms underlying stress and relaxation responses. By integrating
machine learning with EEG data, our approach significantly enhances the understanding
of psychological states and their neural correlates. This contributes to the burgeoning
field of neuroinformatics by providing a reliable method for categorizing EEG data into
stressed and relaxed states. The interpretability offered by Grad-CAM advances our
comprehension of brain processes related to stress and relaxation, thereby offering fresh
perspectives on stress management strategies and mental health interventions. Overall,
our study presents a robust methodology for EEG-based psychological state evaluation
with potential applications in clinical settings and beyond.
